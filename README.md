This is AI questionnaire, as you get into account profile you should fill the form about your personal details and, the most import, your field of study, according to your field the AI will generate kinda quiz and at the end will tell you overall score. To do that we have used tsx node.js express.js opanai apis and tailwindcs for styling.

There is a little bug in the Client/src/pages/Questionnaire.tsx, we get the data and sort it right but still there're some issues
